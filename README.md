Hello everyone! ✌ ✌  My name is Egor Burkin and I am a professional programmer and software developer. I  specialize in creating effective programs to revolutionize business with Python and  Django.

I have been using these two languages for many years, creating comprehensive and user-friendly web solutions for many companies. Recently, I had the opportunity to help one of my clients transform their enterprise with the help of software.

Volodymyr Levchenko is the owner of an e-commerce company in the production of automotive parts. Initially, he reached out to me because his site was suffering from glitches and inefficiencies: a broken cart, inadequate search parameters, etc. I assessed the problems that hindered successful work and came up with a solution based on Python and   Django – two powerful tools for creating interactive Sites.

After a thorough study of the customer's needs, coding began - an exciting stage for any programmer! New data models were built... Emerging problems were quickly resolved... The code has been optimized... Gradually, we went to the final goal. As a result, the result exceeded all expectations! It's finally the day to launch a new website! People were just amazed at how easy it is to use: a user-friendly interface, a simple product selection process with filters... Non-essential duties were performed seamlessly thanks to Python's robust features...

It was amazing! Vladimir no longer hears grumbling from his customers about the complexity of using the service - only positive reviews! Vladimir's startup received significant benefits from the transition from   an archaic system to a new one. And the  performance of Python/Django made it all possible! Can this be considered a victory?
